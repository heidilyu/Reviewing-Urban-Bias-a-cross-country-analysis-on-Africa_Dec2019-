# Reviewing-Urban-Bias-a-cross-country-analysis-on-Africa_Dec2019-
A research project to fulfill the requirement of Political Economy of Africa Development at SAIS. 

The research aims to examine the impact of urban-bias policy on agriculture growth in contemporary Africa. 

It's a cross-country analysis employing FE models. The files in this folder include those for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization and could be used to replicate my project.
